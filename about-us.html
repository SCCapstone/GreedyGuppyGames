                I have long had a passion for games and the communities that they build. 
                Having been involved with various communities over the years and having had experience serving as Community Manager 
                for a group of over 100,000 players I know just how much gaming can bring people together. I hope to continue the 
                tradition of making games and help grow the larger gaming community.

                I have always had an affinity for games. Like most people, I started playing games as a 
                kid and it eventually grew into a deeper appreciation for everything that makes games great. In college, my relationship to 
                games deepened through competitive Smash Brothers and casually playing most other games, this helped me understand what I 
                personally enjoy in games and I hope that I can contribute more to people out there like me!

                I am very enthusiastic about video games, computers, electronics and vehicles. My first console was a Game Boy, I remember 
                having to play under a light to be able to see it at night (Kids these days will never understand the struggle). I love 
                building computers, I just get this sense of fulfillment when it's completed and boots for the first time. I also mod/repair 
                various electronics (Game Boy's, DS's, PS Vita's). I modded my PS Vita and found a plethora of user made games and that's 
                actually how I decided that I wanted to do some type of game development, and how cool is it to be able to do so for our 
                Senior project.

                I have been passionate about games since I was younger. I started out playing games on my Super 
                <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2b8b104364679618157037b70a0471b5ecc9a4f19e331d3ece659cb6a2117f2a/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e646973636f72646170702e636f6d2f6174746163686d656e74732f3734353831313437323237333337353234352f3735313531373239393735313634393437322f31373336313835355f313437393633383233353339333131335f333536393037313534373135373334383532385f6e2e6a7067"
                 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:white">Nintendo</a> when I was younger 
                and have transformed that to having multiple systems as well as a custom built computer. I played League of Legends competitively 
                at Ohio State for a little while until I ultimately left school and joined the Air Force. Since then my love for gaming and its 
                community has evolved and I hope it continues to grow in the future.

                Like others I've been playing video games passionately for the majority of my life, starting with Age of Empires and StarCraft 1 
                when I was around 5. Since then I've always had an interest in video games and computers in general, building my first one when I was 13 
                years old. I've been a part of many communities both small and large and hope to participate in many more.
